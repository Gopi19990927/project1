                         <p style="margin-top: 25px;">A Study by Ashish Das, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
                        Mumbai, 22nd May 2024: A pathbreaking new research benchmarks reasonableness of service 
                        charges levied by banks across India. The study, authored by Dr Ashish Das, Professor, 
                        Department of Mathematics, from the Indian Institute of Technology- Bombay (IIT-B), was 
                        commissioned by Moneylife Foundation. According to the Author, Dr. Das, this report is a holistic 
                        assessment of banks.
                        We are proud to share that the report says IDFC FIRST Bank come out as class apart vis-à-vis 
                        other banks in the private sector.

                        the Category A Banks, IDFC FIRST Bank is the only Bank that charges ZERO FEES on all services
                        in savings accounts, on all account variants, urban or rural, irrespective of AMB, whether Rs. 
                        5000 (offered in Rural India), 10,000 or Rs. 25000.
                        The Moneylife Ashish Das report points out that On-Us (own banks) ATM cash withdrawal, 16 
                        banks charge Rs 10 or less, while the remaining 9 banks charge at the caps set by RBI (Rs 20 or 
                        Rs 21). IDFC FIRST Bank is the only Bank that provides unlimited ATM cash withdrawal without 
                        any fees. For Off-Us (other banks), while all banks charge Rs 20 or Rs 21, IDFC FIRST Bank 
                        charges ZERO.
                        IDFC FIRST Bank is one of the only four banks which do not charge for IMPS transactions. It is 
                        also one of the few banks that do not charge for SMS alerts which may vary to Rs. 100 or Rs. 150 
                        per quarter, where limits have been specified by banks or higher if there are no limits specified.
                        The report also says that IDFC FIRST Bank is the only bank in India that does not charge debit card 
                        for any variant of its savings account, while annual fee for debit cards at most banks ranges from 
                        Rs 100 to Rs 300.
                        As per the report, NACH “mandate registration” are NIL at IDFC FIRST Bank, while charges in 
                        the system vary between Rs. 36 to Rs 108. Further, for failed NACH mandate, on an average, 
                        banks charge between Rs 261 to Rs. 455 while IDFCFB is the only bank that charges ZERO fees 
                        for failed NACH Mandate.
                        While these are the specific comparisons made in the report, we are proud that IDFC FIRST Bank 
                        offers unique customer friendly and customer first product propositions including ZERO fees for 
                        many other services such as RTGS, NEFT, Cash Deposit at branches and online, 3rd party

                        and all 28 such services that are usually charged in the market. IDFC FIRST Bank follows the 
                        principle that it wont touch its customers bank account for any reason whatsoever so 
                        customers can have total peace of mind. The bank does not have the concept of “home” branch, 
                        and all nearly 1000 branches of the bank are Home Branches for the customer, hence the bank 
                        does not have “non-Home branch” access charges.
                        Even in case customer do not maintain minimum balance requirements, then only AMB 
                        maintenance charges apply and IDFC FIRST bank does not charge any fees for these services 
                        mentioned above for customers not able to maintain minimum balances.Finally, the bank removed complicated calculations, legalese, and descriptions that customers 
                        normally don’t understand.
                        This report is a path breaking work by Prof. Das, that compares all banks in India in painstaking 
                        detail to bring it together</p>
